The Arterial Blood Pressure Triggering System was designed at SickKids hospital as a tool for retrospective gating in 4dFlow MRI imaging of fetal Yorkshire pigs' hearts. The system uses robust blood pressure peak recognition algorithms that are not susceptible to high frequency noise or baseline drift. 

The system was designed with usability in mind. The system is entirely plug-and-play, all you have to do is connect your pressure catheter, run an RCA cable to the MRI scanner's external trigger input port, and connect the USB cable to any computer. After that the system will automatically calibrate itself, and trigger continuously.

## Hardware

Features:

* compatible with pressure catheters from Transonic and Samba sensors
* device automatically adjusts signal gain as required
* voltage regulation circuitry complete with inline fuses ensures that the MRI scanner is protected from potentially harmful voltage surges in the case of either the pressure sensor or the computer having an electrical fault


## BP Trigger Monitor

The monitoring tool is not required to use the triggering unit, but it can be used to ensure that triggering is happening properly while the experiment is running. On the top graph it shows the input signal from the pressure catheter, and on the bottom it shows the triggering signal that's been sent to the scanner. These graphs are updated in real-time with <20ms of delay, so you'll be aware of any irregular heartbeats, or problems with the pressure catheter, right as they happen.
